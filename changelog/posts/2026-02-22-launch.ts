I'm excited to announce the launch of **Miked.live**! 🚀

## The Journey

I started in music by producing tracks and playing guitar. Eventually, I was in a band for a bit and did a few shows. Communication between band members is hard, especially when you're just starting out. But the biggest frustration came from the sound itself—bad mixing, bad tech communication, and poor sound quality on gigs. Those painful experiences inspired me to become a freelance audio engineer. Now I see the problem from both sides of the table: I understand the pain points from the engineer's perspective. I know exactly what information I need before a gig, what gets lost in communication, and how frustrating it is when artists don't have their technical specs organized.

When it comes to communicating your technical needs to venues and engineers, the tools available aren't great. Before each gig, we'd go through this whole process: ask band members what gear they're bringing, wait for replies, edit old stage plots in Photoshop, create technical riders—Word docs, spreadsheets, PDFs—repeating the same tedious workflow every time. It was hours of work just to send something to a venue. And here's the real problem: you mostly communicate with the venue, not the engineers. You never really know if they read it, or if they're actually prepared when you show up on gig day. The stage plot tools can be basic or cumbersome, and the process of creating and updating them is just painful.

**The tools for communicating technical needs just aren't optimal, and the communication itself doesn't reach the people who need it most.**

Then I discovered AI tools for building. Over the years, I've built my own websites and apps, so I understand the friction of web development—the boilerplate, the configuration, wrestling with frameworks. I built my first website for my freelance audio engineering business with AI assistance, and it was transformative. What would normally take me weeks moved so much faster. I suddenly had the bandwidth and speed to think bigger.

That's when everything clicked. I realized: I could actually build that thing I'd been thinking about—an online platform where bands could actually communicate their technical needs properly. Instead of spending weeks architecting every detail, I could describe the vision and iterate with AI by my side. It's like finally having a developer partner who gets it, who understands what you're trying to build and helps you move fast without getting bogged down.

## Building Miked.live

Here's what I've built:

**Drag & Drop 3D Stage Designer** — This was a fun but bold decision. Instead of boring spreadsheets or PDFs, I created an interactive 3D stage where you can literally drag your equipment around. Visualizing your setup in 3D makes way more sense, and I'm genuinely excited that people are appreciating this unconventional approach. It's satisfying to build something that actually feels modern.

**Smart Tech Rider Generation** — Once you've placed your gear, I automatically generate a professional PDF technical rider. No filling out forms, no copying and pasting. Everything you configured becomes a clean, venue-ready document that actually gets read.

**Instant Visual Reference** — Export a PNG of your stage plot. Engineers and venue staff can see exactly what you need at a glance. It's way better than describing it in words.

**No Friction** — Zero account creation, zero paywall, zero nonsense. Just open it, build your rider, download it. That's it.

**Quick Setup** — Whether you're a solo artist with a guitar or a full band with a truck of gear, you can get everything organized and ready to send to venues way faster than traditional methods.

## Why I'm Doing This

It's free because I believe venues and engineers deserve to have your tech specs without you jumping through hoops. And I'm building this in public because I genuinely want feedback from people like me—musicians, engineers, and anyone who's ever been frustrated trying to communicate technical needs.

This is about making live audio better. Better communication means better shows. And better shows are what it's all about.

## The Real Vision

Right now, Miked.live generates static PDFs and stage plots. But that's just the beginning. My goal is to build the **best rider creation tool out there**—something so good that people actually use it without thinking twice.

But here's the bigger picture: I want to solve the communication problem once and for all. Instead of static documents that sit in someone's inbox, imagine a **living platform where venues, engineers, and band members are all on the same page**. Real-time updates. Everyone sees the latest changes. No more surprises on gig day because the engineer didn't read your PDF from three weeks ago.

That's what I'm building towards. First, let's nail the rider tool. Then, let's make sure the right people actually see what you need—and stay updated when things change.

Give it a try and let me know what you think!
