I'm excited to announce the launch of **Miked.live**! 🚀

## The Journey

I started in music by producing tracks and playing guitar. Eventually, I was in a band for a bit and did a few shows. Communication between band members is hard, especially when you're just starting out. And when it comes to communicating your technical needs to venues and engineers, the tools available aren't great.

Before each gig, we'd go through this whole process: ask band members what gear they're bringing, wait for replies, edit old stage plots in Photoshop, create technical riders—Word docs, spreadsheets, PDFs—repeating the same tedious workflow every time. It was hours of work just to send something to a venue. And here's the real problem: you mostly communicate with the venue, not the engineers. You never really know if they read it, or if they're actually prepared when you show up on gig day. The stage plot tools can be basic or cumbersome, and the process of creating and updating them is just painful.

**The tools for communicating technical needs just aren't optimal, and the communication itself doesn't reach the people who need it most.**

Then I discovered **Claude Code**—and it changed how I think about building. AI is genuinely great at helping you build websites. Instead of spending weeks on boilerplate, I could describe what I wanted and have it help me build faster. It was like finally having a developer partner who understood the vision.

So I thought—why not build something that fixes this problem?

## Building Miked.live

I started building without knowing if it would work, but with AI by my side, it actually became possible.

Here's what I've built:

**Drag & Drop 3D Stage Designer** — This was a fun but bold decision. Instead of boring spreadsheets or PDFs, I created an interactive 3D stage where you can literally drag your equipment around. Visualizing your setup in 3D makes way more sense, and I'm genuinely excited that people are appreciating this unconventional approach. It's satisfying to build something that actually feels modern.

**Smart Tech Rider Generation** — Once you've placed your gear, I automatically generate a professional PDF technical rider. No filling out forms, no copying and pasting. Everything you configured becomes a clean, venue-ready document that actually gets read.

**Instant Visual Reference** — Export a PNG of your stage plot. Engineers and venue staff can see exactly what you need at a glance. It's way better than describing it in words.

**No Friction** — Zero account creation, zero paywall, zero nonsense. Just open it, build your rider, download it. That's it.

**Quick Setup** — Whether you're a solo artist with a guitar or a full band with a truck of gear, you can get everything organized and ready to send to venues way faster than traditional methods.

## Why I'm Doing This

It's free because I believe venues and engineers deserve to have your tech specs without you jumping through hoops. And I'm building this in public because I genuinely want feedback from people like me—musicians, engineers, and anyone who's ever been frustrated trying to communicate technical needs.

This is about making live audio better. Better communication means better shows. And better shows are what it's all about.

Give it a try and let me know what you think!
